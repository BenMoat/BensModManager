 <b>Ben's Mod Manager Â· Version 1.1</b>
</h1>

## Features
### Sorting:
Columns can be asynchronously sorted by the [mod name, price or mod type](https://github.com/BenMoat/BensModManager/blob/master/Controllers/ModsController.cs#L61-#L76):
* Upon load, the table is sorted by the mod name in ascending order. 
  * Selecting a column header will sort it by ascending order at first, clicking it a second time will sort it by descending order and vice versa.

### Red and green PDF symbols:
* Added Font Awesome PDF symbols to each record to make it easier to tell if a mod as the invoice attached to it or not.
  * A Green PDF symbol means a file is attached to the mod. 
  * A Red PDF symbol  means there is _no_ file attached to the mod.

## Fixes & Improvements
### The total price calculation:
This now remains static at the total price of _all_ mods, not the queried mods. 
* When querying a mod, a second price will be displayed to show the total price of the queried mods _on top_  of the total price of mods.

   _(here is how money I ~wasted~ spent on interior carbon parts)_ 

### Replaced the local array of mod types in the site.js file with an AJAX call to the [controller](https://github.com/BenMoat/BensModManager/blob/master/Controllers/ModsController.cs#L97-L106):

### Other fixes & improvements:
* Fixed a TomSelect source mapping issue when trying to launch the web app in Debug mode. 
* The mod notes' height now [animates](https://github.com/BenMoat/BensModManager/blob/master/wwwroot/js/site.js#L60-#L62) to the height of the content inside of it. 
* Globalised the site's font colour and reduced the HTML noise from repetitive class references. 
* Reorganised the site.css file to make it easier to read. 
* Replaced all local libraries with CDNs.
